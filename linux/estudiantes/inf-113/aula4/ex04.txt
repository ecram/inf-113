top:
DESCRIPTION
       The  top  program  provides  a dynamic real-time view of a running system.  It can display
       system summary information as well as a list of processes or threads currently being  man‐
       aged  by  the  Linux kernel.  The types of system summary information shown and the types,
       order and size of information displayed for processes are all user configurable  and  that
       configuration can be made persistent across restarts.

       The program provides a limited interactive interface for process manipulation as well as a
       much more extensive interface for personal configuration  --  encompassing every aspect of
       its  operation.   And  while  top is referred to throughout this document, you are free to
       name the program anything you wish.  That new name, possibly an alias, will  then  be  re‐
       flected on top's display and used when reading and writing a configuration file.
